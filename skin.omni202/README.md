<h1>OMNI202</h1>

This is a fork of the OMNI skin for Kodi called OMNI202 for its omnipresent menus and 202 as a reference to the version it is based on. Users of Mimic will recognize that it was the base for OMNI. OMNI202 is much more streamlined than Mimic, however, and doesn't have as many customisation options. Here's what you need to know:

- The main menu and submenus are accessible from every window. Press left from the main menu and everything will slide to the right, revealing the submenu.
- The main menu and info dialog menus use icons only. Although it may not be absolutely clear at first what some options do, you will quickly figure out what they are.
- Press right from the window content or scrollbar to access the media menu. Or press "m" on your keyboard or remote.
- Only keyboard and remote input are supported. Mouse input is entirely untested.

Forked from OMNI by braz96, based on v2.0.2 commit 6aac4343e5
https://github.com/braz96/skin.omni/tree/6aac4343e5e3bf83dd67ab482bff4de328994855

Aim is to restore script.skinshortcuts and custom widgets functionality, with backported and personal future fixes.
